# Course Details

## Teaching team

### Instrutor

* Dr. Benjamin Soltoff - soltoffbc@uchicago.edu

### Teaching assistants

TBD?

---

## Themes: what, why, and how

- **What:** the plot
  - Specific types of visualizations for a particular purpose (e.g., maps for spatial data, Sankey diagrams for proportions, etc.) 
  - Tooling to produce them (e.g., specific R packages)

--
- **How:** the process
  - Start with a design (sketch + pseudo code)
  - Pre-process data (e.g., wrangle, reshape, join, etc.)
  - Map data to aesthetics
  - Make visual encoding decisions (e.g., address accessibility concerns)
  - Post-process for visual appeal and annotation

--
- **Why:** the theory
  - Tie together "how" and "what" through the grammar of graphics

# Course policies

---

## Collaboration policy

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively (Projects)

- Homeworks must be completed individually. You may not directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

---

## Sharing / reusing code policy

- We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

---

class: middle, inverse

# Course Tools

---

## RStudio 

- Local R installations

- [Software setup instructions](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/#option-2-install-the-software-locally)

---

## GitHub

.center[.large[https://github.com/dataviz-sp22]]

<br>

- GitHub organization for the course

- All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private

- Each assignment is a private repo on GitHub, I distribute the assignments on GitHub and you submit them there

- Feedback on assignments is given as GitHub issues, only points recorded on Canvas gradebook

.task[
Fill out the *Collecting GitHub Usernames* survey for collection of your account names, later this week you will be invited to the course organization.
]

---

## Username advice

.hand[in case you don't yet have a GitHub account...]

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember

- Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss

- Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible

- Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence

---

## GitHub Discussions

.center[.midi[https://github.com/dataviz-sp22/discussion/discussions]]

<br>

- Online forum for asking and answering questions

- Private repo in the course organization

- You will need to join the course organization for access

- Ask **and answer** questions related to course logistics, assignment, etc. here

- Personal questions (e.g., extensions, illnesses, etc.) should be via email to me

Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*:

> 1. It is truthful, as it’s based on thorough and honest research.
> 
> 2. It is functional, as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it’s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time).
> 
> 3. It is beautiful, in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience—scientists, in the first place, but the general public, too.
> 
> 4. It is insightful, as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise.
> 
> 5. It is enlightening because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the better.

# What makes a great visualization?

> Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation of interesting data**—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design … [It] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. … [It] is that which **gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space** … [It] is nearly always multivariate … And graphical excellence requires **telling the truth about the data**.
