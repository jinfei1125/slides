## Figure sizing

For more on including figures in R Markdown documents with the right size, resolution, etc. the following resources are great:

- [R for Data Science - Graphics for communication](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html)
- [Tips and tricks for working with images and figures in R Markdown documents](https://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# set default figure parameters for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 8, # 8"
  fig.asp = 0.618, # the golden ratio
  fig.retina = 3, # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina
  dpi = 300, # higher dpi, sharper image
  out.width = "70%"
)
```

## Data prep: new variables

From last class...

```{r}
scorecard <- scorecard %>%
  mutate(pctpell_cat = cut_interval(x = pctpell, n = 6)) %>%
  drop_na(pctpell_cat)

scorecard %>%
  count(pctpell_cat)
```

---

## Data prep: summary table

From last class...

```{r}
mean_netcost_pctpell <- scorecard %>%
  group_by(pctpell_cat) %>%
  summarise(mean_netcost = mean(netcost, na.rm = TRUE))

mean_netcost_pctpell
```

# Aesthetic mappings in ggplot2

---

## Global vs. layer-specific aesthetics

- Aesthetic mappings can be supplied in the initial `ggplot()` call, in individual layers, or in some combination of both.

- Within each layer, you can add, override, or remove mappings.

- If you only have one layer in the plot, the way you specify aesthetics doesnâ€™t make any difference. However, the distinction is important when you start adding additional layers.

## Activity: Spot the difference I

.task[
Do you expect the following plots to be the same or different? If different, how? Discuss in a pair (or group) without running the code and sketch the resulting plots based on what you think the code will produce.
]

```{r fig.show = "hide"}
# Plot A
ggplot(scorecard, aes(x = satavg, y = netcost, color = pctpell_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.5)

# Plot B
ggplot(scorecard, aes(x = satavg, y = netcost)) +

# Geoms

---

## Geoms

- Geometric objects, or geoms for short, perform the actual rendering of the layer, controlling the type of plot that you create

- You can think of them as "the geometric shape used to represent the data"

---

## One variable

- Discrete:
  - `geom_bar()`: display distribution of discrete variable.

- Continuous
  - `geom_histogram()`: bin and count continuous variable, display with bars
  - `geom_density()`: smoothed density estimate
  - `geom_dotplot()`: stack individual points into a dot plot
  - `geom_freqpoly()`: bin and count continuous variable, display with lines

---

## .hand[aside...]

Always use "typewriter text" (monospace font) when writing function names, and follow with `()`, e.g., 

- `geom_freqpoly()`
- `mean()`
- `lm()`

---

1. Show the detailed distribution of a single continuous variable
1. Focus attention on the overall relationship between two variables in a large dataset
1. Label outlying points in a single variable

## Homework 1

.task[
- Locate your Homework 1 repo, clone it in RStudio
- Put your name in the YAML of `homework-01.Rmd`, knit, commit (with a meaningful message), push
- Skim the README to get a sense of the instructions and use the remaining time to ask any clarifying questions and to get started on the first question
- Make sure you know how to ask a question on the course discussion forum, and set up notifications
]

## Homework 1 tips

- You can go in order or jump around between exercises. If you get stuck
  on a specific exercise, feel free to switch to a different one.

- But, of course, do what feels right for you in terms of pace, ordering, etc.!

- And ask questions on the course discussion forum
